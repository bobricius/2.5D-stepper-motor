It is compatible with standard stepper motor diver, cnc or GRBL shield, 
direct replacement of X-Y stepper motors. 

With flexible boards you can partial move in Z axe :) if you warp board. 
Magnet is moved only in horizontal X-Y space. It can push small object, I have no way 
now how to pick and place object or I have no communication and feedback from robot. 

Feedback is possible with camera or hall sensors under board, also there is way 
to communicate with bot over NFC/RFID with coil under board... untested now 

you can move only one magnet, more magnets move paralel, but you can 
divide moving space to zones and use more robots ... etc parking zones if you have more 
magneboots with different tools 

My latest design use 0.6mm board but this is very fat, 
bottom trackers are weak compared to top trackers 

I have plan make only tracking part from flex and controller as normal 1.6mm board 

5x5mm moving magnets 4pcs x 2mm magnet .
